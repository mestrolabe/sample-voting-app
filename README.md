 :computer:  Simple Angular application built for the Front-End Web Development course I'm teaching.  
 <br>
 :page_facing_up: It covers introductory materials and is a great starting point to get comfortable with the Angular project structure and the basics.  
 <br>
 :art: For styling purposes I've used [Fomantic UI Framework](https://fomantic-ui.com/).
